Project Beneficial Scrape (Java)

Inspired by internship my roommate currently holds, where he has to scans a LinkedIn business for the CEO, summary, e-mail.

Design - scrape given page for html file
	 find key information, such as the CEO, business summary, and e-mail
	 find pertenant information on said company to dertemine if they should be approached or not. 
	 build gui for easy access.
	 e-mail to roommate.

Project is currently ongoing. Have created a class that can scrape html from websites. Still need to determine how to isolate
desired information (which is probably within the <p> </p> tags) and how to judge whether company is good or not. Design of simple 
GUI needed.
